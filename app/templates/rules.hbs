      <div class="rules-section">
        <h4>How To Play</h4>
          Pick 1 team to win each day of the tournament.
          We'll send you an email reminder to come back and make your picks
          each time we update the daily game matchups.
          You must pick a different team each day (no picking Kentucky on day 1 and on day 3!).
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
          <h4>The Spread</h4>
            Spread is determined by a difference in seed. Example: a 16 seeds gets +15 points against a 1 seed.
            <em>As long as your team wins</em>, you survive. The spread will determine how many bonus points you get, if any.
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
          <h4>Strikes</h4>
          If your pick loses outright (regardless of the spread), you get a strike.
          3 strikes and you're <span class='serious-words'>eliminated</span> from the pool.
          If you did not to make a pick for a game day in time, that also counts as a strike.
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
        <h4>Bonus Points</h4>
        If your team beats the spread, every additional point also goes to you.
        <h5>e.g. if a 5 seed beats a 7 seed by 10 points, you get 8 points (10 point victory margin minus the 2-point spread)</h5>
        <h5>e.g. if a 7 seed beats a 5 seed by 3 points, you get 5 points (3 point victory margin plus the 2-point spread)</h5>
