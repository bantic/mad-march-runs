<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>
  Thanks for joining Mad March Runs. The game works in two parts: the macro part called "March Runs" and the micro part called "Mad Survivor." 
</p>

<h2> Part 1: March Runs </h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Pick 3 teams in the field of 64 that you think will make deep runs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scoring: 1 Point &times; Seed &times; Wins = Team Point Total (so if #2 seed Gonzaga wins 3 games, that's worth 6 points).
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Bonus points:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
  Last team standing in the entire pool = 16 point bonus (all ties get the full 16 points).
      </li>
      <li>
  Team reaches final four = 4 point bonus.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
Part 2: Mad Survivor  (Daily Pick)
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  Pick ONE TEAM to win against the spread EACH DAY of the NCAA Tourney (we'll send you a link to pick from a menu for each of the 10 days).
  </li>
  <li>
  You can't pick the same team more than once for the entire tourney.
  </li>
  <li>
  The difference in seed serves as the point spread (so a 16 seed gets +15 points against a 1 seed).
  </li>
  <li>
  If your team fails to beat the spread, that's a strike. 3 strikes and you're ELIMINATED from the pool.
  </li>
  <li>
  If a player fails to make a pick (or out of teams), she gets a strike.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Bonus points:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
  If your team beats the spread, you get bonus points that equal how many points your pick beat the spread by.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
  Overall Winner
</h2>
<p>
The player that survives the micro game + accumulates the most points (in both parts of the game) wins the pool.
