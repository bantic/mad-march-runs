<h2>Daily Survivor Picks</h2>

<h3>Your picks</h3>
<ul class="picks">
{{#each session.currentUser.picks as |pick|}}
  <li class='pick'>Round: <b>{{pick.round.name}}</b>:
    You picked {{pick.team.name}} ({{pick.team.seed}})</li>
{{else}}
  <li class='empty'>You have not selected any picks yet.</li>
{{/each}}
</ul>

<p>
  For each of the available rounds below, click "Select Matchup" next to the
  game you want to pick, then click the button to lock in the team you think
  will <em>win</em>.
  The spread is determined by the difference in the team seeds and will
  determine your bonus points if your team wins.
  If your team <em>loses outright</em>, you'll get a strike. 3 strikes and you're
  eliminated!
</p>

<p>
  Read the {{'link-to' 'full rules' 'rules'}} for more info.

<p>
  Once you click the "lock in my pick" button, your pick will be locked in for that
  day and <em>cannot be changed</em>.
