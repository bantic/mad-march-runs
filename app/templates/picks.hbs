  For each of the available rounds below, click "Select Matchup" next to the
  game you want to pick, then click the button to lock in the team you think
  will <em>beat the spread</em>. The spread is determined by the difference
  in the team seeds. Read the {{'link-to' 'full rules' 'rules'}} for more info.

  Once you click the "lock in my pick" button, your pick will be locked in for that
  day and <em>cannot be changed</em>.
