      <div class="rules-section">
        <h4>How To Play</h4>
          Pick 1 team to win against the spread each day of the tournament. We'll send you a list to pick from every day of the tournament and you must pick a different team each day (no picking Kentucky on day 2 and on day 3!)
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
          <h4>The Spread</h4>
            Spread is determined by a difference in seed. e.g. a 16 seeds gets +15 points against a 1 seed.
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
          <h4>Strikes</h4>
          Each time your pick fails to beat the spread, you get a strike. 3 strikes and you're <span class='serious-words'>eliminated</span> from the pool. If you choose not to make a pick, you also get a strike.
      </div>
      <div class="rules-section">
        <h4>Bonus Points</h4>
        If your team beats the spread, every additional point also goes to you. 
        <h5>e.g. if a 16 seed loses by 8 points, you get 7 points</h5>
